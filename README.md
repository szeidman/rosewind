## About

This site is a Rails API with a React front end and middleware that lets users filter charities and nonprofits listed on Charity Navigator (charitynavigator.org) and save and annotate favorites.

## Local install
To get started, clone the repository, run bundle install from the root and then npm install from the client folder. You will also need to register for API keys from Charity Navigator and add them to a .env file. Run "rake start" from the terminal to launch both the front and back ends.
